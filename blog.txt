Title: Shiny Tutorial Report

Problems found during the exercises:
- Understand the way of interacting between user interface patrt and server one
- Understand the role of the helpers.R file
- For whom has never used bootstrap it is a little bit long to learn how to use all the display organization (grid,...)
- Not understood very well the exercise 7 and how to share an R application

Personal comments:
- R is a really advanced friendly language, useful to separate ui, server and helpers with all the user functions
- Easy to handle the user interface with the close similarity between shiny and bootstrap
- One of us already has an experience in web application which has been really useful

Constructive review:
- It could be useful to study a little further the several examples of the shiny gallery because they provide a lot
  typical use case which are easy to reuse
- The tutorial is mainly based on map displays of the data, it could be better if we could have studied some examples
  of other graphical representations

Estimated time to complete the exercise: 3 hours for the code itself, 1 hour for the structure of the delivery
