Title: Innovative design tool Report

Problems found during the exercises:
- Understand the way of interacting between user interface patrt and server one
- Difficulties to use particular libraries such as plotly with shiny 
- Difficulties to create layers on the leaflet map so we abandonned
- We didn't manage to make queries in the server part to display the masters, the function was working manually
  (it is commented in the helper.R file) but displays random results in the shiny app

Personal comments:
- A lot of libraries are available both for the display and the data analysis which allows to simply run 
  clustering for example and do interactive plots
- Maybe this quantity of libraries can be a trap sometimes because you don't which one to choose as several can allow
  you to do what you want

Constructive review:
- We didn't know when to stop addinf functionalities, maybe it could be better to have a more precise specifications
- But in a personal point of view this way of free development of the application was really instructive and we have
  learned a lot things we will reuse during our respective internships

Estimated time to complete the exercise: 6 days
